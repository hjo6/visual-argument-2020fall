# 100 Seconds
For my visual argument, I sought to create an image that conveyed the urgency behind the idea
of the Doomsday Clock. As the website defines it, "The Doomsday Clock is a design that warns the public about how
close we are to destroying our world with dangerous technologies of our own making. It is a metaphor, a reminder of the
perils we must address if we are to survive on the planet" [ (Source).](https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/faq/) To briefly summarize, the Doomsday Clock represents how close we are to destroying our world. In January 2020, it was announced that we were officially 100 Seconds to Midnight.

To represent this idea visually, I decided to take an image of the Earth and modify each of the colors to make the Earth
look dry, desolate, and uninhabitable. To do this, I selected the "Image" drop bar at the top of GIMP, then switched
"Mode" to Indexed and I chose to index the image into 100 colors. I modified each color to get the final "desolate Earth"
image. I then took the original image and found the proper angle between 11:58:20 PM and midnight on a clock and
cropped it to just be a slice between the clock and hour hands. I placed it where it fit, then added clock hands and clock
numbers. Finally, I added the text.

Originally, I focused on the climate change aspect of the Doomsday Clock, but I took some feedback from our preview
day and decided to link to the website with information regarding the Doomsday Clock and what an individual can do to
help reverse the damage that has already been inflected on Earth, or in essence pushing back the clock so that we have
more time to fix what needs to be fixed. I did this because some suggested that, since this image is a call to action, it
should provide some information regarding what an individual can do to help push back time. Additionally, some were
confused by my choice of 100 seconds, so I wanted to include a link that would further specify why exactly I chose this
number and not 60 seconds or 30 minutes.
