# Time is Running Out

This is the repository for my visual argument for Composing Digital Media. My
current idea is to create an argument that calls for action against climate
change. My current idea takes the concept of the Doomsday Clock (a clock that
symbolically represents the amount of time we have until the apocalypse) and
synthesize that with an image of Earth. Between the clock hands, Earth will be
beautiful, blue, and green, and outside of the hands, the Earth will look
desolate and uninhabitable. I want to include text at the bottom that warns
people the imminent danger we are in if we don't take action right now.
